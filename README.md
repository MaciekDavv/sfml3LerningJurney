# SFML Learning Project

This repository contains my experiments and learning exercises based on the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) multimedia library.  
I'm using this project to deepen my knowledge of modern C++ (C++23) and real-time graphics/game development.

## Inspiration and Sources

My primary learning resources and inspiration come from:

- [Hopzbie's GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Hopzbie?tab=repositories)  
  Hopzbie provides clean, understandable examples using SFML and C++.
- [Hopzbie's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hopzbie)  
  I follow along with tutorials that cover SFML game mechanics, UI design, and rendering.

The code I write is based on the techniques and concepts presented in those resources, adapted to my own learning and style.

## What I'm Building

This project is a playground for:

- Practicing SFML features (window management, rendering, input handling)
- Building simple game systems
- Learning C++23 best practices through implementation

## How to Build

Requirements:
- C++23 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.20+
- Git (for fetching SFML via `FetchContent`)
